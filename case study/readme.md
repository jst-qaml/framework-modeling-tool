# Case Study

We prepared the case study of traffic sign image classification to demonstrate how M3S works with our plugin. Please refer to [our publication](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11219-024-09687-z) for the details.

## Case Study Description

The case study is based on object classification ML models for autonomous driving cars (ADV). Here, the scope of the classification task is limited to traffic sign classification. The inputs for the ML model classification are color images from an embedded camera system as the sensors of the overall ADV system. The classification result is sent to the decision-making ML model as a decision-making input for the car’s control system. 

ADV is required to work at level three of vehicle autonomy. In level three conditions, the autonomous part returns the driving responsibility to the driver when ADV is operated outside the preferable domain. To train and test the model, we used the publicly available German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset (Stallkamp et al., 2012, 2011). The GTSRB dataset consists of images of German traffic signs that fit the case study.

The case study considers two operation domains. The first one is the highway. Because this domain is free of pedestrians and bikes, traffic signs indicating such objects are non-existent. The second one is suburban roads, where pedestrians and bikes are more prevalent. The highway domain is prioritized from an economic standpoint, whereas the suburban road domain is preferable from the users standpoint. The JAMA Framework Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (2021) and Aurora’s safety case framework for ADVsFootnote 3 serve as the basis to ensure that the case study reflects the real world as much as possible. To fit the ML model to both cases, DNN repair may be utilized to improve the performance of important classes. However, if no version of trained ML models satisfies both cases, the highway domain is prioritized. The configuration of the repair process must reflect such concerns.
