## Astah* System Safety and System Requirements

This plugin is made for Astah* System Safety version 8.0.0 (https://astah.net/release-notes/system-safety-8-0/). Please refer to Astah* System Safety system requirements for the details.

Compatibility with newer versions is not guaranteed.

## Preparation

To set a network connection with the backend side, do the following:

1. Access the [SSHFramework.java](src/main/java/ai/engineering/pipeline/SSHConnector.java).
2. Set the IP address, username, password, and port in the following section:
   ```
   //Set the host IP, username, password, and port for training server
    static String host = "";
    static String user = "";
    static String password = "";
    static String port = ""
   ```
3. Set the local directory for temporary files to be stored. The default is the D drive root folder.
   ```
   //Set the local folder to hold temporary files
   static String local = "D:";
   ```
4. Compile the plugin.

## Compiling
To create your own version of the binary, follow the Astah* System Safety plugin development tutorial:

[https://astah.net/support/plugin-dev-tutorial/plugin-development-setup-for-astah-system-safety/]

## Installation
Installation can be done in two ways:

- Drop the .jar file into the opened Astah System Safety instance to install.
- Restart the Astah System Safety for the installation to be implemented.

OR

- From the **Plugin** menu, open **Installed Plugins...**
- Click **Install**
- Select the .jar file
- Restart the Astah System Safety for the installation to be implemented.

## Manual
More complete instructions on how to operate the plugin are available on the manual below.
[docs/manual.md](docs/manual.md)

## Integrated Metamodel
Access the metamodel folder to access the integrated metamodel of M3S. Editable Astah* Professional file is also available.

## Case Study

We prepared the case study of traffic sign image classification to demonstrate how M3S works with our plugin. Please refer to (our publication)[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11219-024-09687-z] for the details.

## Pattern Application

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This feature requires Astah* System Safety with object constraint language (OCL) to work. Please contact Astah representative for availability.

### Install
First of all, you need to install the plugin into astah* System Safety. Please visit the [plugin download page](/target/astah_pattern_application-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) and download it. Then, you can install it. The plugin can be installed in one of the following ways:

1. Drag and drop the plugin file onto the Astah* window.
2. Install from the "Install" button on the plugin list.

To use the installed plugins, you must restart Astah* after installation ([install the plugin in astah* System Safety official site](https://astah.change-vision.com/ja/manual-sys/reference/basic_function/plugin.html#id3)).

### Machine Learning Reliability Solution Patterns
With this plugin, you can use the following Machine Learning Reliability Solution Patterns (Table 2).

### Usage of the plugin

#### Step 1 Pattern applicability indication

First, open the pattern selection support view and activate the plug-in. If there is a pattern in the GSN diagram open at that time that can be applied, the name of the pattern and the location where it is applied will be displayed (Figure 1). In Figure 1, P1, P2, and P4 could be applied at G31, and P5 could be applied at G32.

*Figure 1: Example of Step 1 Pattern applicability indication.*

#### Step 2 Select a pattern

Selecting a pattern that was displayed in green will display the pattern application method options. Select the appropriate option from here (Figure 2). If P1 is selected in Figure 1, the result is Fogure 2. In this case, there are three options: G31 matches the pattern, G31 and S3 match the pattern, or G31 and S4 match the pattern.

*Figure 2: Example of Step 2 Select a pattern.*

#### Step 3 Pattern application

Finally, the pattern is applied by selecting an option (Figure 3). If in Figure 2 the case where G31 and S4 match the pattern is selected, then Figure 3 is shown. This applied the pattern.

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, we showed how to use a pattern application support framework. The above results are expected to complement engineers' prior knowledge and reduce human error.
